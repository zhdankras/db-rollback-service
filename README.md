# Database rollback service
## Service. How it works?
The service performs the following functions:
1. Database(**overhull-dev**) cleanup;
2. Migrates tables by sending a post request to Pipelines API;
3. Adds data to tables(**auth_users**, **accounts**, **users**, **projects**)

The service is integrated with the Slack application. This means that you can use the functionality of the service with the slash command Slack. Since Sla—Åk applications can use socket mode, the service will work properly.
